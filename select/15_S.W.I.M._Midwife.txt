I don't want to swim forever
Treading water my whole life
You know I can't swim forever
I don't want to fight the tide

I don't want to live forever
Paranoid for my whole life
I don't want to live forever
You had a gun, I only had a knife

You know I can't swim forever
Treading water my whole life
I don't want to swim forever
Reaching for the other side

I don't want to live forever
I don't want to stay the same
I don't want to live forever
I can't even say your name

I don't want to swim forever
Treading water my whole life
You know I can't swim forever

I don't want to fight the tide
