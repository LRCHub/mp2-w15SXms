If you really didn't need it, I denied it
Couldn't see you niggas sleeping, I was grinding
Had the crib in Piccadilly, move my mind mint
Man, I say you niggas silly, different timing
But there's a nigga fucking with me, I should dodge him
I remember back in Philly, eating ramen
My head be clouded in the city, hard to process
They wanna see me in the city with the mob ment'
Had me counting every penny, had the goblet
I stay around, these niggas envy, I'm the proudest
Chopped it with my brother living, he an outlet
My success just make 'em livid 'cause they doubted

My papa hate to see me sitting, see me slouching
Like my mama, in my feelings, I be drowning
I be drowning, see me sitting, see me slouching
Like my mama, in my feelings, I be drowning

I be drowning, yeah, yeah
All this drama never sit straight with me
When I'm alone, know my sister'll miss me
All I've known is the scars that I've hidden
Ten days strong, now I'm lost, keep wishing
Now I'ma ball 'cause my pop was in prison
Picking up my armor, then I march to the rhythm
Among the trees, buried dreams, found wisdom
Start my day, give thanks for my newfound vision
Blame it on the world, but my girl said I'm tripping
Son of a goon, caught in this mysticism
It was all in the words and the cards that were dealt
When the car hit the curb, brother ain't around
My father pray I check, my wrist is green and brown
Listen here, the sound, brothers in the struggle
Glad we took a different route, mama made a home
Father in a different house, we was in a drought
Had to make it work, had to make it work
When my brother passed, then came the hurt
Then came the hurt, then came the-
Had to make it work, had to make it work
Then came the hurt, then came the hurt
Then came the-, and then came the hurt
Yeah, then came the hurt
